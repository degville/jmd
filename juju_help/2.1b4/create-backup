Usage: juju create-backup [options] [<notes>]

Summary:
Create a backup.

Options:
-B, --no-browser-login  (= false)
    Do not use web browser for authentication
--filename (= "juju-backup-<date>-<time>.tar.gz")
    Download to this file
-m, --model (= "")
    Model to operate in. Accepts [<controller name>:]<model name>
--no-download  (= false)
    Do not download the archive

Details:
create-backup requests that juju create a backup of its state and print the
backup's unique ID.  You may provide a note to associate with the backup.

The backup archive and associated metadata are stored remotely by juju.

The --download option may be used without the --filename option.  In
that case, the backup archive will be stored in the current working
directory with a name matching juju-backup-<date>-<time>.tar.gz.

WARNING: Remotely stored backups will be lost when the model is
destroyed.  Furthermore, the remotely backup is not guaranteed to be
available.

Therefore, you should use the --download or --filename options, or use:

    juju download-backups

to get a local copy of the backup archive.
This local copy can then be used to restore an model even if that
model was already destroyed or is otherwise unavailable.
