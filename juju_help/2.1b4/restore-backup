Details:
Restores a backup that was previously created with "juju create-backup".

This command creates a new controller and arranges for it to replace
the previous controller for a model.  It does *not* restore
an existing server to a previous state, but instead creates a new server
with equivalent state.  As part of restore, all known instances are
configured to treat the new controller as their master.

The given constraints will be used to choose the new instance.

If the provided state cannot be restored, this command will fail with
an appropriate message.  For instance, if the existing bootstrap
instance is already running then the command will fail with a message
to that effect.
