By default (without argument), the status of the model, including all
applications and units will be output.

Application or unit names may be used as output filters (the '*' can be used as
a wildcard character). In addition to matched applications and units, related
machines, applications, and units will also be displayed. If a subordinate unit
is matched, then its principal unit will be displayed. If a principal unit is
matched, then all of its subordinates will be displayed.

The available output formats are:

- tabular (default): Displays status in a tabular format with a separate table
      for the model, machines, applications, relations (if any) and units.
      Note: in this format, the AZ column refers to the cloud region's
      availability zone.
- {short|line|oneline}: List units and their subordinates. For each unit, the IP
      address and agent status are listed.
- summary: Displays the subnet(s) and port(s) the model utilises. Also displays
      aggregate information about:
      - Machines: total #, and # in each state.
      - Units: total #, and # in each state.
      - Applications: total #, and # exposed of each application.
- yaml: Displays information about the model, machines, applications, and units
