Usage: juju add-unit [options] <application name>

Summary:
Adds one or more units to a deployed application.

Options:
-m, --model (= "")
    Model to operate in. Accepts [<controller name>:]<model name>
-n, --num-units  (= 1)
    Number of units to add
--to (= "")
    The machine and/or container to deploy the unit in (bypasses constraints)

Details:
Adding units to an existing application is a way to scale out that application. 
Many charms will seamlessly support horizontal scaling, others may need an
additional application to facilitate load-balancing (check the individual 
charm documentation).
This command is applied to applications that have already been deployed.
By default, applications are deployed to newly provisioned machines in
accordance with any application or model constraints. Alternatively, this 
command also supports the placement directive ("--to") for targeting
specific machines or containers, which will bypass any existing
constraints.

Examples:
Add five units of wordpress on five new machines:

    juju add-unit wordpress -n 5

Add one unit of mysql to the existing machine 23:

    juju add-unit mysql --to 23

Create a new LXD container on machine 7 and add one unit of mysql:

    juju add-unit mysql --to lxd:7

Add a unit of mariadb to LXD container number 3 on machine 24:

    juju add-unit mariadb --to 24/lxd/3
