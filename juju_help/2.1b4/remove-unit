Details:
Remove application units from the model.

Units of a service are numbered in sequence upon creation. For example, the
fourth unit of wordpress will be designated "wordpress/3". These identifiers
can be supplied in a space delimited list to remove unwanted units from the
model.

Juju will also remove the machine if the removed unit was the only unit left
on that machine (including units in containers).

Removing all units of a service is not equivalent to removing the service
itself; for that, the `juju remove-service` command is used.

Examples:

    juju remove-unit wordpress/2 wordpress/3 wordpress/4
