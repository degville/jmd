Usage: juju remove-machine [options] <machine number> ...

Summary:
Removes one or more machines from a model.

Options:
-B, --no-browser-login  (= false)
    Do not use web browser for authentication
--force  (= false)
    Completely remove a machine and all its dependencies
-m, --model (= "")
    Model to operate in. Accepts [<controller name>:]<model name>

Details:
Machines are specified by their numbers, which may be retrieved from the
output of `juju status`.
Machines responsible for the model cannot be removed.
Machines running units or containers can be removed using the '--force'
option; this will also remove those units and containers without giving
them an opportunity to shut down cleanly.

Examples:

Remove machine number 5 which has no running units or containers:

    juju remove-machine 5

Remove machine 6 and any running units or containers:

    juju remove-machine 6 --force
