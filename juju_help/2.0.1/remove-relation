Usage: juju remove-relation [options] <application1>[:<relation name1>] <application2>[:<relation name2>]

Summary:
Removes an existing relation between two applications.

Options:
-B, --no-browser-login  (= false)
    Do not use web browser for authentication
-m, --model (= "")
    Model to operate in. Accepts [<controller name>:]<model name>

Details:
An existing relation between the two specified applications will be removed. 
This should not result in either of the applications entering an error state,
but may result in either or both of the applications being unable to continue
normal operation. In the case that there is more than one relation between
two applications it is necessary to specify which is to be removed (see
examples). Relations will automatically be removed when using the`juju
remove-application` command.

Examples:
    juju remove-relation mysql wordpress

In the case of multiple relations, the relation name should be specified
at least once - the following examples will all have the same effect:

    juju remove-relation mediawiki:db mariadb:db
    juju remove-relation mediawiki mariadb:db
    juju remove-relation mediawiki:db mariadb
