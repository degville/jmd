Usage: juju get-model-constraints [options]

Summary:
Displays machine constraints for a model.

Options:
-B, --no-browser-login  (= false)
    Do not use web browser for authentication
--format  (= constraints)
    Specify output format (constraints|json|yaml)
-m, --model (= "")
    Model to operate in. Accepts [<controller name>:]<model name>
-o, --output (= "")
    Specify an output file

Details:
Shows machine constraints that have been set on the model with
`juju set-model-constraints.`
By default, the model is the current model.
Model constraints are combined with constraints set on an application
with `juju set-constraints` for commands (such as 'deploy') that provision
machines for applications. Where model and application constraints overlap, the
application constraints take precedence.
Constraints for a specific application can be viewed with `juju get-constraints`.

Examples:

    juju get-model-constraints
    juju get-model-constraints -m mymodel
