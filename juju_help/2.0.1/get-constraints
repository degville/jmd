Usage: juju get-constraints [options] <application>

Summary:
Displays machine constraints for an application.

Options:
-B, --no-browser-login  (= false)
    Do not use web browser for authentication
--format  (= constraints)
    Specify output format (constraints|json|yaml)
-m, --model (= "")
    Model to operate in. Accepts [<controller name>:]<model name>
-o, --output (= "")
    Specify an output file

Details:
Shows machine constraints that have been set for an application with `juju set-
constraints`.
By default, the model is the current model.
Application constraints are combined with model constraints, set with `juju 
set-model-constraints`, for commands (such as 'deploy') that provision
machines for applications. Where model and application constraints overlap, the
application constraints take precedence.
Constraints for a specific model can be viewed with `juju get-model-
constraints`.

Examples:
    juju get-constraints mysql
    juju get-constraints -m mymodel apache2
