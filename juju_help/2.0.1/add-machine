Usage: juju add-machine [options] [<container>:machine | <container> | ssh:[user@]host | placement]

Summary:
Start a new, empty machine and optionally a container, or add a container to a machine.

Options:
-B, --no-browser-login  (= false)
    Do not use web browser for authentication
--constraints (= "")
    Additional machine constraints
--disks  (= )
    Constraints for disks to attach to the machine
-m, --model (= "")
    Model to operate in. Accepts [<controller name>:]<model name>
-n  (= 1)
    The number of machines to add
--series (= "")
    The charm series

Details:
Juju supports adding machines using provider-specific machine instances
(EC2 instances, OpenStack servers, MAAS nodes, etc.); existing machines
running a supported operating system (see "manual provisioning" below),
and containers on machines. Machines are created in a clean state and
ready to have units deployed.

Without any parameters, add machine will allocate a new provider-specific
machine (multiple, if "-n" is provided). When adding a new machine, you
may specify constraints for the machine to be provisioned; the provider
will interpret these constraints in order to decide what kind of machine
to allocate.

If a container type is specified (e.g. "lxd"), then add machine will
allocate a container of that type on a new provider-specific machine. It is
also possible to add containers to existing machines using the format
<container type>:<machine number>. Constraints cannot be combined with
deploying a container to an existing machine. The currently supported
container types are: lxd, kvm.

Manual provisioning is the process of installing Juju on an existing machine
and bringing it under Juju's management; currently this requires that the
machine be running Ubuntu, that it be accessible via SSH, and be running on
the same network as the API server.

It is possible to override or augment constraints by passing provider-specific
"placement directives" as an argument; these give the provider additional
information about how to allocate the machine. For example, one can direct the
MAAS provider to acquire a particular node by specifying its hostname.
For more information on placement directives, see "juju help placement".

Examples:
   juju add-machine                      (starts a new machine)
   juju add-machine -n 2                 (starts 2 new machines)
   juju add-machine lxd                  (starts a new machine with an lxd container)
   juju add-machine lxd -n 2             (starts 2 new machines with an lxd container)
   juju add-machine lxd:4                (starts a new lxd container on machine 4)
   juju add-machine --constraints mem=8G (starts a machine with at least 8GB RAM)
   juju add-machine ssh:user@10.10.0.3   (manually provisions a machine with ssh)
   juju add-machine zone=us-east-1a      (start a machine in zone us-east-1a on AWS)
   juju add-machine maas2.name           (acquire machine maas2.name on MAAS)
