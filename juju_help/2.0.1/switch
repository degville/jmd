Usage: juju switch [options] [<controller>|<model>|<controller>:<model>]

Summary:
Selects or identifies the current controller and model.

Options:
-B, --no-browser-login  (= false)
    Do not use web browser for authentication

Details:
When used without an argument, the command shows the current controller 
and its active model. 
When switching by controller name alone, the model
you get is the active model for that controller. If you want a different
model then you must switch using controller:model notation or switch to 
the controller and then to the model. 
The `juju models` command can be used to determine the active model
(of any controller). An asterisk denotes it.

Examples:
    juju switch
    juju switch mymodel
    juju switch mycontroller
    juju switch mycontroller:mymodel
