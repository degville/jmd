Usage: juju set-default-credential <cloud name> <credential name>

Summary:
Sets the default credentials for a cloud.

Details:
The default credentials are specified with a "credential name". A 
credential name is created during the process of adding credentials either 
via `juju add-credential` or `juju autoload-credentials`. Credential names 
can be listed with `juju credentials`.
Default credentials avoid the need to specify a particular set of 
credentials when more than one are available for a given cloud.

Examples:
    juju set-default-credential google credential_name
