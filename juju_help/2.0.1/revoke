Usage: juju revoke [options] <user> <permission> [<model name> ...]

Summary:
Revokes access from a Juju user for a model or controller

Options:
-B, --no-browser-login  (= false)
    Do not use web browser for authentication
-c, --controller (= "")
    Controller to operate in

Details:
By default, the controller is the current controller.

Revoking write access, from a user who has that permission, will leave
that user with read access. Revoking read access, however, also revokes
write access.

Examples:
Revoke 'read' (and 'write') access from user 'joe' for model 'mymodel':

    juju revoke joe read mymodel

Revoke 'write' access from user 'sam' for models 'model1' and 'model2':

    juju revoke sam write model1 model2

Revoke 'add-model' access from user 'maria' to the controller:

    juju revoke maria add-model
