Usage: juju credentials [options] [<cloud name>]

Summary:
Lists credentials for a cloud.

Options:
--format  (= tabular)
    Specify output format (json|tabular|yaml)
-o, --output (= "")
    Specify an output file
--show-secrets  (= false)
    Show secrets

Details:
Credentials are used with `juju bootstrap`  and `juju add-model`.
An arbitrary "credential name" is used to represent credentials, which are 
added either via `juju add-credential` or `juju autoload-credentials`.
Note that there can be multiple sets of credentials and thus multiple 
names.
Actual authentication material is exposed with the '--show-secrets' 
option.
A controller and subsequently created models can be created with a 
different set of credentials but any action taken within the model (e.g.:
`juju deploy`; `juju add-unit`) applies the set used to create the model. 
Recall that when a controller is created a 'default' model is also 
created.
Credentials denoted with an asterisk '*' are currently set as the default
for the given cloud.

Examples:
    juju credentials
    juju credentials aws
    juju credentials --format yaml --show-secrets
