Usage: juju show-action-output [options] <action ID>

Summary:
Show results of an action by ID.

Options:
-B, --no-browser-login  (= false)
    Do not use web browser for authentication
--format  (= yaml)
    Specify output format (json|yaml)
-m, --model (= "")
    Model to operate in. Accepts [<controller name>:]<model name>
-o, --output (= "")
    Specify an output file
--wait (= "-1s")
    Wait for results

Details:
Show the results returned by an action with the given ID.  A partial ID may
also be used.  To block until the result is known completed or failed, use
the --wait flag with a duration, as in --wait 5s or --wait 1h.  Use --wait 0
to wait indefinitely.  If units are left off, seconds are assumed.

The default behavior without --wait is to immediately check and return; if
the results are "pending" then only the available information will be
displayed.  This is also the behavior when any negative time is given.
