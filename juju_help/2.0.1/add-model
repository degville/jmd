Usage: juju add-model [options] <model name> [cloud|region|(cloud/region)]

Summary:
Adds a hosted model.

Options:
-B, --no-browser-login  (= false)
    Do not use web browser for authentication
-c, --controller (= "")
    Controller to operate in
--config  (= )
    Path to YAML model configuration file or individual options (--config config.yaml [--config key=value ...])
--credential (= "")
    Credential used to add the model
--owner (= "")
    The owner of the new model if not the current user

Details:
Adding a model is typically done in order to run a specific workload.
To add a model, you must at a minimum specify a model name. You may
also supply model-specific configuration, a credential, and which
cloud/region to deploy the model to. The cloud/region and credentials
are the ones used to create any future resources within the model.

Model names can be duplicated across controllers but must be unique for
any given controller. Model names may only contain lowercase letters,
digits and hyphens, and may not start with a hyphen.

Credential names are specified either in the form "credential-name", or
"credential-owner/credential-name". There is currently no way to acquire
access to another user's credentials, so the only valid value for
credential-owner is your own user name. This may change in a future
release.

If no cloud/region is specified, then the model will be deployed to
the same cloud/region as the controller model. If a region is specified
without a cloud qualifier, then it is assumed to be in the same cloud
as the controller model. It is not currently possible for a controller
to manage multiple clouds, so the only valid cloud is the same cloud
as the controller model is deployed to. This may change in a future
release.

Examples:

    juju add-model mymodel
    juju add-model mymodel us-east-1
    juju add-model mymodel aws/us-east-1
    juju add-model mymodel --config my-config.yaml --config image-stream=daily
    juju add-model mymodel --credential credential_name --config authorized-keys="ssh-rsa ..."
