Usage: juju destroy-model [options] [<controller name>:]<model name>

Summary:
Terminate all machines and resources for a non-controller model.

Options:
-B, --no-browser-login  (= false)
    Do not use web browser for authentication
-y, --yes  (= false)
    Do not prompt for confirmation

Details:
Destroys the specified model. This will result in the non-recoverable
removal of all the units operating in the model and any resources stored
there. Due to the irreversible nature of the command, it will prompt for
confirmation (unless overridden with the '-y' option) before taking any
action.

Examples:

    juju destroy-model test
    juju destroy-model -y mymodel
