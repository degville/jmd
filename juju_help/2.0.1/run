--application  (= )
    One or more application names

    How long to wait before the remote command is considered to have failed
--unit  (= )
    One or more unit ids

Details:
Run the commands on the specified targets. Only admin users of a model
are able to use this command.

Targets are specified using either machine ids, application names or unit
names.  At least one target specifier is needed.

Multiple values can be set for --machine, --application, and --unit by using
comma separated values.

If the target is a machine, the command is run as the "ubuntu" user on
the remote machine.

If the target is an application, the command is run on all units for that
application. For example, if there was an application "mysql" and that application
had two units, "mysql/0" and "mysql/1", then
  --application mysql
is equivalent to
  --unit mysql/0,mysql/1

Commands run for applications or units are executed in a 'hook context' for
the unit.

--all is provided as a simple way to run the command on all the machines
in the model.  If you specify --all you cannot provide additional
targets.

Since juju run creates actions, you can query for the status of commands
started with juju run by calling "juju show-action-status --name juju-run".
