Usage: juju remove-application [options] <application>

Summary:
Remove an application from the model.

Options:
-B, --no-browser-login  (= false)
    Do not use web browser for authentication
-m, --model (= "")
    Model to operate in. Accepts [<controller name>:]<model name>

Details:
Removing an application will terminate any relations that application has, remove
all units of the application, and in the case that this leaves machines with
no running applications, Juju will also remove the machine. For this reason,
you should retrieve any logs or data required from applications and units 
before removing them. Removing units which are co-located with units of
other charms or a Juju controller will not result in the removal of the
machine.

Examples:
    juju remove-application hadoop
    juju remove-application -m test-model mariadb
